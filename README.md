# BlackBug
JavaScript particle animation library using HTML5 Canvas element
released under the GPL.

A personal experiment in making a JavaScript particle animation framework
for use with the canvas element. Allows you to adjust the particle emitter
size and position, as well as the velocity, acceleration, birth rate, and
lifetime of the particles. Also allows you to customize their appearance by
choosing their color gradient, size, and shape.
